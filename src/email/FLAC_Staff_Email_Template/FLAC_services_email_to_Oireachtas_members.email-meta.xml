    <subject>Overview of FLAC&apos;s legal information &amp; advice services</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Senators &amp; Deputies,


As we come to what is likely to be another difficult budget, we know that increasing numbers of people will be under renewed pressure and stress to find solutions to problems that often have legal aspects, sometimes with distressing health and social repercussions.

Over the past months, therefore, we have had numerous requests for more detail on what kind of legal information and advice services FLAC can provide.

To this end, I attach a short description of what we can do to help people in need of legal information and advice. We are an independent legal rights organisation which exists to promote equal access to justice for all. We recognise that many people cannot afford to access the legal help that they need to manage their affairs.

We cannot and do not try to substitute for the state-funded legal aid services but we hope that what we can do will be of assistance to the people with whom you work or who consult you with difficulties.

I&apos;d be grateful if you could circulate this information to anyone in your office who might find it useful.

Kind regards,

Noeline
