    <textOnly>Dear Committee Members,





I am writing to you on behalf of FLAC and our fellow independent law centre, Northside Community Law Centre, based in Coolock in Dublin. We are sending you this joint submission of our concerns on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill which we note has been debated at Second Stage yesterday, 5 June 2014 and is due to go to Committee on Wednesday next. This submission is going to all of the members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee.  If there is someone else that you would like us to send it to, we can do that. If you have any questions about this, please do not hesitate to contact me or my colleagues as follows:
