    <textOnly>Dear all



I trust this email finds you well.



We have received a request from an organisation that advocates on behalf of people in institutional care (acute psychiatric units, training centres, day centres and day hospitals etc).



The organisation is seeking a suitably experienced legal practitioner to deliver a legal education session on the topic of &apos;Human Rights and Institutional Care&apos;. Ideally the legal education session would incorporate the Criminal Insanity Act and the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Bill 2013. The content of the session will also be informed by hypothetical scenarios presented to the legal practitioner one week prior to the session.



I would be most grateful if you could please come back to me with expressions of interest by close of business Friday 5 September.



Thank you to everyone who is doing pro bono work we are very grateful!



Kind regards,

Eamonn.
