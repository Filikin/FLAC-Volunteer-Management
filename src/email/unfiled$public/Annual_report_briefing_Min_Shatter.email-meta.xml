    <textOnly>Dear Minister,

Thank you  again for launching FLAC’s Annual Report for 2011 at our office on Dorset  Street last Monday, we were delighted with how the event went.

As a result of this, your colleague Deputy Alan  Farrell has kindly arranged for FLAC to do a briefing to TDs and Senators in  the AV Room next week. At this briefing, FLAC will present on various aspects  of its work and will answer any questions arising.

Date: Thursday 5 July 2012

Time: 11am – 12pm

Location: AV Room, Leinster House

If you or  one of your colleagues are available to attend, we would be delighted to see  you there.

We are  putting together the photos from last week’s event and will send them on to you  when we have them.

Kind  regards

Noeline
