    <subject>Personal Insolvency Bill 2012. FLAC reaction to ECB comment</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Senators and Deputies


Please find attached a submission that we made to the office of the European Central Bank last Friday 21 September 2012. We were prompted to do so following the publication by the Bank of its Opinion on the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012. (CON 2012/70 ECB Public https://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/en_con_2012_70_f.pdf)


We thought that because of your membership of a relevant Oireachtas Committee, you might be interested in FLAC’s reaction, where we take issue with some underlying assumptions in the opinion and note the absence of the consumer perspective. If you want to discuss the matter any further, please do not hesitate to contact me or my colleague Paul Joyce.
