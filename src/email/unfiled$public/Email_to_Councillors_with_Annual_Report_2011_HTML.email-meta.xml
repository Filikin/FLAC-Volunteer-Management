    <subject>FLAC Briefing on Annual Report 2011 - Thurs 5 July</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Councillor {!Contact.LastName},

I am pleased to attach an electronic copy of FLAC’s Annual  Report for 2011 which was recently launched at FLAC’s office on Dorset Street  by the Minister for Justice, Equality &amp; Defence Alan Shatter TD.

As you’ll see from the report, in  FLAC&apos;s key areas of work in 2011, we concentrated on providing practical,  useful legal information to the public and to other bodies working with the  public, on monitoring the state&apos;s duty to respect, protect and realise basic  human rights, and on promoting legal reform that is progressive, fair and that  advances social justice. This includes:

- clarifying consumer credit rights around Hire  Purchase in the Gabriel case
- working with other organisations on a set of  basic principles to overcome personal debt,
- preparing guides on topics like the Code of  Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Social Welfare Appeals process and the  Civil Legal Aid system,
- campaigning for the recognition of transgender  people and the rights of deaf people to serve on juries,
- advocating for a fairer and more transparent  social welfare system,
progressing public interest law in Ireland via  the Public Interest Law Alliance project (PILA) which provides legal  training and pro bono legal assistance and support to NGOs from its  register of lawyers and legal firms, and
- providing basic legal information through a  dedicated phone-line team and offering free legal advice at 80 locations  around Ireland.


We hope  that you find FLAC’s Annual Report 2011 both interesting and relevant.

Kind  regards

Noeline
