    <subject>FLAC correction to email on Personal Insolvency and ECB Opinion</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Members of the European Parliament


I sent you an email earlier today relating to the Opinion of the ECB on Ireland’s Personal Insolvency Bill 2012. I meant to send you FLAC’s reaction to the Opinion as an attachment. Instead, I attached the actual Opinion.


With sincere apologies for the inconvenience, I now attach FLAC’s reaction to that Opinion, for your consideration.


Kind regards

Noeline
