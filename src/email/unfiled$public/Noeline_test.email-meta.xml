Dear Noeline,

This lady called this morning and said that you have spoken with her before about her case. She had social welfare issue and she was refused legal Aid in Denmark. You asked her to call back if she has some new information and now she has something new to say.

Please contact her back at 0868983356

She has a hearing with the Social welfare on Tuesday morning and she wants you to go with her.
